# Elevate-Labs-Task-02

In the above Taskfolder you can find all the necessary files regarding Task-2.In the jupyter file 'task2_soltions.ipynb' I have done the Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic-Dataset and that is also provided.I have mainly used pandas,matplotlib and seaborn to complete the task2 in the below manner:

#### 1.Data Summary:
Basic statistics (mean, median, quartiles) were generated for numerical features like age, fare, and passenger class using describe method.

#### 2.Visualisations
Distributions: Histograms and boxplots for numeric features (e.g., age, fare) to identify skewness, outliers, and data spread.\n
Relationships: Pairplots and correlation heatmaps to highlight linear associations between features (e.g., fare vs. survival).
